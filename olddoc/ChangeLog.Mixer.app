1.8.0		- Released 2002-09-15

1.7.0		- Released 2001-06-25
		- Fixed compilation problems.

1.6.0		- Released 2001-03-17
		- Mixer.app is now devfs friendly, which means it will try to
		  use /dev/sound/mixer or /dev/sound/mixer1 first and fall back
		  to /dev/mixer if that didn't work.
		- New Makefile.

1.5.0		- Released 2000-02-21.
		- Added command line options -s and -S <file>, which cause 
		  Mixer.app to load/save volume settings when starting/exiting.
		  When the option -s is used, settings are loaded from/saved in
		  ~/GNUstep/Defaults/Mixer. Use -S <file> if you want Mixer.app
		  to use a different file.
		- Fixed potential bug in command line parsing.

1.4.1		- Released 1999-05-28.
		- Added command line option -l <text> that can be used to 
		  add a text label in the corner of the mixer.

		- Added support for wheel mice. One of the sliders (use -w to 
		  specify which one) will react on wheel movement. 
		- Misc. code clean up.

		- Fixed problem that caused Mixer.app to die.

		- Rewrote command-line parsing, not using getopt anymore.
		- Minor code clean up.

1.3.0		- Released 1999-02-04.
		- New design.
		- I didn't find the mute function very usefull so I removed it.
		- Doing 'make install' will now install it in 
                  /usr/local/GNUstep/Apps/Mixer.app/.

1.2.0		- Released 1998-12-01.
		- Moved back to old design. The design of version 1.1.1 made 
		  Mixer.app (and Window Maker) unstable due to some strange 
                  race condition at startup. It worked on some machines and 
		  some not, so I desided to go back to the old design.
		- Increased idle interval to reduce CPU usage.

1.1.1		- Released 1998-11-14.
		- Fixed XGetImage errors, (slow machines may still have this 
		  problem, please report any errors).

		- Added command line option -n <name> to set instance name.
		- Compiling under FreeBSD now works fine.
